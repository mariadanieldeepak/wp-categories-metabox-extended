WP Categories Metabox Extended plugin allows you to search and assign Categories
to your post in your WordPress editor.

== Description ==  

WP Categories Metabox Extended extends the Category metabox on your WordPress editor. Once installed the Category metabox gets a search bar with which you search Categories. Also, this is only seen on "Add New Post" screen in the WordPress Admin dashboard.

From [WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-0/), the search bar is included with the Categories metabox. In case you choose to use the Classic editor by using plugins like [Disable Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-gutenberg/), then WP Categories Metabox Extended plugin will continue to extend the Categories metabox for the default "Post" post type.
